# Sprite Mag and Border

## What brought me here
I tried out [Farworld Pioneers Wiki on Wiki.gg](https://farworldpioneers.wiki.gg/wiki/Farworld_Pioneers_Wiki) and noticed that the wiki was missing a lot of creatures and none of them had their sprites uploaded. So I used AssetStudio to grab the sprites and found the [Image Formatting Guidelines](https://farworldpioneers.wiki.gg/wiki/Meta:_Image_Formatting).

Pretty simple: x6 upscaling, 6px top and bottom transparent padding, and a 6px border around the actual sprite with the sprite centered.

## What I wanted to achieve
Instead of just grabbing one sprite for each creature in the game and manually editing them, I grabbed all of them with intent to automate the Sprite Editing process and keep things nice and tidy.

The full process looks something like this:
1. Export Asset.xml file from AssetStudio
2. Process Asset.xml to get list of creatures
3. 

I want to tackle the extraction process of the sprites at some point, but that's bonus content relative to the task at hand.
